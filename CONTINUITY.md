# Continuity Ledger

- Goal (incl. success criteria): Add authoritative documentation map + Codex operating rules to README files; include ChatGPT Pro login/no API key note.
- Constraints/Assumptions: Follow AGENTS.md (minimal scoped changes; keep ASCII). approval_policy=never.
- Key decisions: Add a single ASCII sentence to each README in the most relevant section.
- State:
  - Done: Fixed research.py f-string syntax error and pushed. Phase 0.5 work completed previously.
  - Now: Added documentation map + Codex operating rules to README.md, README_NEW_FEATURES.md, and agent/README.md; added ChatGPT Pro/no API key note where missing.
  - Next: Commit and push README updates if user approves.
- Open questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed): None.
- Working set (files/ids/commands): README.md; README_NEW_FEATURES.md; agent/README.md; CONTINUITY.md
