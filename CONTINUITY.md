# CONTINUITY.md
- Goal (incl. success criteria):
  - Document rebuild plan and snapshot current system state; preserve current state in git.
- Constraints/Assumptions:
  - Create new docs: `REBUILD_PLAN.md`, `CURRENT_STATE.md`.
  - Commit current state after updates.
- Key decisions:
  - Use current dates (Dec 28, 2025+) in rebuild timeline to avoid past-date confusion.
  - Capture what works vs broken and list tools/integrations.
  - Exclude `agent/memory/autonomous_memory.sqlite3` from version control and add it to `.gitignore`.
- State:
  - Done:
    - Read `CONTINUITY.md` and refreshed goal/constraints to current task.
    - Created `REBUILD_PLAN.md`.
    - Created `CURRENT_STATE.md`.
    - Updated docs to reflect current reality (chat ok, playbooks partial, swarm broken, manual Google OAuth).
    - Updated model profiles and routing in config and code.
    - Switched Google OAuth playbook steps to Windows-MCP tools.
    - Added `.gitignore` entry and removed `agent/memory/autonomous_memory.sqlite3` from index.
  - Now:
    - Ready to commit current state in git.
  - Next:
    - Run `git commit` for current state.
- Open questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed):
  - None.
- Working set (files/ids/commands):
  - `REBUILD_PLAN.md`
  - `CURRENT_STATE.md`
  - `CONTINUITY.md`
  - `git status`, `git add`, `git commit`
