# Continuity Ledger

- Goal (incl. success criteria): Implement Phase 0 foundation in DrCodePT-Swarm per CODEX_IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md; create new modules, update existing files, add tests, update requirements; ensure pytest passes.
- Constraints/Assumptions: Follow AGENTS.md (minimal scoped changes, no destructive actions, log phase banners, run pytest -q for relevant changes, safe-by-default). Keep ASCII. approval_policy=never. Use specific exception handling and logging; no broad except Exception.
- Key decisions: Repo is C:\Users\treyt\OneDrive\Desktop\DrCodePT-Swarm. Phase 0 is current focus.
- State:
  - Done: Located repo and prompt; AGENTS.md read.
  - Now: Create Phase 0 files/updates and tests.
  - Next: Implement Phase 0 changes, run pytest -q, report results.
- Open questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed): Should I create a git commit after Phase 0? UNCONFIRMED.
- Working set (files/ids/commands): CODEX_IMPLEMENTATION_PROMPT.md; AGENTS.md; CONTINUITY.md
