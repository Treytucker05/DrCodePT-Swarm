# Continuity Ledger

- Goal (incl. success criteria): Fulfill user request to implement Phases 0-7 end-to-end in DrCodePT-Swarm; verify repo already contains those changes and respond with status.
- Constraints/Assumptions: Follow AGENTS.md (minimal scoped changes, no destructive actions, log phase banners, run pytest -q for relevant changes, safe-by-default). Keep ASCII. approval_policy=never. Must commit changes and create PR only if new changes are made.
- Key decisions: Phase 0-7 files already present; avoid overwriting existing implementations.
- State:
  - Done: Confirmed key Phase 0 files exist; no additional implementation changes required.
  - Now: Record status and commit continuity ledger update.
  - Next: Create PR for ledger update and report that Phase 0-7 is already implemented.
- Open questions (UNCONFIRMED if needed): None.
- Working set (files/ids/commands): CONTINUITY.md; git status -sb
