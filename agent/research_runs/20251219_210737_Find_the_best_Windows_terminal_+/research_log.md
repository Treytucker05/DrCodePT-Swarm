## Research Log
- 21:07:53 [PROFILE] balanced
- 21:12:23 [PLAN] Generating subtopics (min 4)
- 21:14:19 [PLAN] Subtopics: Windows Terminal baseline setup: default terminal/profile, `settings.json` location, profile ordering, and dynamic profile generation for installed shells., Shell choice inside Terminal: compare PowerShell 7 LTS (install/update channels) and how Windows Terminal auto-creates PowerShell profiles., Python version management on Windows: `py.exe` launcher behavior (version selection/shebangs) plus `venv` isolation and activation flow., Python CLI tooling isolation: use `pipx` to install and manage command-line apps in separate environments., Agent "eyes/hands/ears" tooling survey: browser automation with Playwright, GUI automation with PyAutoGUI, OCR with Tesseract, and offline speech with Vosk.
- 21:14:19 [SUBTOPIC] 1/5 Windows Terminal baseline setup: default terminal/profile, `settings.json` location, profile ordering, and dynamic profile generation for installed shells.
- 21:15:49 [GAPS] Windows Terminal baseline setup: default terminal/profile, `settings.json` location, profile ordering, and dynamic profile generation for installed shells.: How do per-user vs system-wide defaults interact (Windows Terminal “Default terminal application” vs Windows 11 “Default terminal” OS setting), and which wins when both are set?; What are the exact behaviors/limits of dynamic profiles (sources supported, disable flags, and how to override or hide generated profiles without breaking updates)?; How do multiple installs (Stable, Preview, Store, unpackaged) coexist: which `settings.json` is active, how to migrate settings cleanly, and how profile GUID collisions are handled?
- 21:19:23 [GAPS] Windows Terminal baseline setup: default terminal/profile, `settings.json` location, profile ordering, and dynamic profile generation for installed shells.: How dynamic profile generation can be toggled or scoped per source (`disabledProfileSources`) and how that affects newly installed shells; How `settings.json` merges with JSON fragment extensions (load order, override precedence), especially for profiles.list ordering; How default profile and profile ordering behave across multiple Windows Terminal installations (Stable vs Preview vs unpackaged) and whether settings can be shared or synchronized without conflicts
- 21:23:23 [WARN] Windows Terminal baseline setup: default terminal/profile, `settings.json` location, profile ordering, and dynamic profile generation for installed shells. pass 3: [CODEX ERROR] Codex CLI timed out after 240s. Try setting CODEX_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=900 and retry.
- 21:23:23 [SUBTOPIC] 2/5 Shell choice inside Terminal: compare PowerShell 7 LTS (install/update channels) and how Windows Terminal auto-creates PowerShell profiles.
- 21:26:15 [GAPS] Shell choice inside Terminal: compare PowerShell 7 LTS (install/update channels) and how Windows Terminal auto-creates PowerShell profiles.: How Windows Terminal chooses the “default profile” when multiple PowerShell versions exist and how to pin a specific pwsh.exe (including store vs MSI vs ZIP paths); Practical differences in profile generation between `Windows.Terminal.PowershellCore` and `Windows.Terminal.Powershell` sources, and when each appears; How to manage multiple PowerShell versions side‑by‑side (path precedence, `$PSHOME`, and upgrade flow) without breaking tooling or Terminal profiles
- 21:31:00 [GAPS] Shell choice inside Terminal: compare PowerShell 7 LTS (install/update channels) and how Windows Terminal auto-creates PowerShell profiles.: Do you want a decision matrix that maps install method to update channel and side-by-side behavior (WinGet/MSI/ZIP/.NET tool/Store; Store auto-updates; MSI/WinGet can use Microsoft Update; ZIP is for multi-version installs)? ([learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows?view=powershell-7.5)); Should we add a "Terminal defaulting rules" callout covering `defaultProfile` (GUID/name; default is PowerShell) and how to disable auto-generated PowerShell profiles via `disabledProfileSources`? ([learn.microsoft.com](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/terminal/customize-settings/startup?utm_source=openai)); Should we include a "pin a specific pwsh.exe" walkthrough: manual profile uses `commandline` (not `source`), optionally hide dynamic profiles, especially when multiple PS7 versions exist?

- 21:32:19 [SUBTOPIC] 3/5 Python version management on Windows: `py.exe` launcher behavior (version selection/shebangs) plus `venv` isolation and activation flow.
- 21:33:30 [GAPS] Python version management on Windows: `py.exe` launcher behavior (version selection/shebangs) plus `venv` isolation and activation flow.: How the launcher chooses between 32‑bit/64‑bit and per‑user vs system installs (and how `py.ini` / `py -0p` reveal paths); How `py.exe` resolves shebangs inside an active venv vs global installs, including `PY_PYTHON` / `PY_PYTHON3` env overrides; How `venv` differs from `virtualenv` and `conda` on Windows for isolation, scripts, and activation (pros/cons for terminal workflows)
- 21:37:30 [WARN] Python version management on Windows: `py.exe` launcher behavior (version selection/shebangs) plus `venv` isolation and activation flow. pass 2: [CODEX ERROR] Codex CLI timed out after 240s. Try setting CODEX_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=900 and retry.
- 21:37:30 [SUBTOPIC] 4/5 Python CLI tooling isolation: use `pipx` to install and manage command-line apps in separate environments.
- 21:38:26 [GAPS] Python CLI tooling isolation: use `pipx` to install and manage command-line apps in separate environments.: How does pipx choose where it stores venvs and shims on Windows, and what are best practices for relocating these to a larger drive or syncing exclusions with OneDrive?; What are the tradeoffs between pipx and alternatives (e.g., Scoop, winget, uv tool install) for Windows CLI tooling, especially regarding update workflows and PATH handling?; What security and trust practices should be used for pipx-installed tools (pinning versions, verifying publishers, auditing deps), given the goal of “tools for any task” without paid software?
- 21:42:26 [WARN] Python CLI tooling isolation: use `pipx` to install and manage command-line apps in separate environments. pass 2: [CODEX ERROR] Codex CLI timed out after 240s. Try setting CODEX_TIMEOUT_SECONDS=900 and retry.
- 21:42:26 [SUBTOPIC] 5/5 Agent "eyes/hands/ears" tooling survey: browser automation with Playwright, GUI automation with PyAutoGUI, OCR with Tesseract, and offline speech with Vosk.
- 21:44:03 [GAPS] Agent "eyes/hands/ears" tooling survey: browser automation with Playwright, GUI automation with PyAutoGUI, OCR with Tesseract, and offline speech with Vosk.: Windows terminal choice + Python stack: best free terminal(s) for automation workflows (Windows Terminal vs. WezTerm vs. Alacritty) and how each integrates with Python/venv, profile launching, and clipboard/ANSI support; Permissions + security: what Windows settings/UAC, accessibility permissions, and app sandboxing (browser profiles, app containers) affect Playwright, PyAutoGUI, Tesseract, and Vosk reliability; Packaging + deployment: how to bundle these tools offline (portable installs, local model files, drivers) and keep them updated without paid services
- 21:47:58 [GAPS] Agent "eyes/hands/ears" tooling survey: browser automation with Playwright, GUI automation with PyAutoGUI, OCR with Tesseract, and offline speech with Vosk.: Security/privilege boundary plan: how you’ll handle UAC prompts, elevated apps, and secure‑desktop screens in end‑to‑end automation; Offline install/updates workflow: how you’ll package, cache, and keep Playwright browsers, Tesseract languages, and Vosk models up to date without internet; Reliability/resilience: how you’ll monitor failures (OCR errors, focus loss, timing drift) and recover with retries, state checks, and fallbacks
